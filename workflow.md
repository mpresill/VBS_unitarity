This set of instructions serves as a guide for "dummies" to reproduce everything is presented in the paper.
Here is a summary of Costanza's thesis to guide the whole work.



# Computation of helicity amplitudes in Mathematica


# MC simulation 


# From LHE to histograms

Codes for the production of histograms are available in the repository https://github.com/mpresill/VBS_unitarity/tree/main/combine/Analysis%20tools/src%20(w%7Co%20bound) (in src (w bound) directory the same codes are present, with the addition of some lines that implement the unitarity cut). The starting file is a .root file obtained from the .lhe file using the ExRootAnalysis package. For the installation of the libraries needed for the correct working of the package follow the instruction here https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/ExRootAnalysis/wiki/UserManual.

## Costanza's workflow
Codes for the production of histograms from .root file are available in the repository https://github.com/mpresill/VBS_unitarity/
tree/main/combine/Analysis%20tools

## Plotting tool
Inspired from [this prototype](https://github.com/acappati/mg5tut_apr21_plots).


# Statistical analysis
